# My-Erasmus-Diary
I have developed a diary where I can track my activities in different fields. The most interesting part about this project is the use of webscraping. I use it to generate random Bible Verses from two different websites. From one website I extract the chapter and the verses and on another romanian website I search for the exact chapter and verse. Also, I use the matplotlib library to generate different graphs for my progress in fields like reading or programming. I used tkinter for the GUI.
